## Mastermind
- Role ability: **Planning**

Your ability to prepare in advance, create contingency plans, or improvise in the moment.

A [[Mastermind]] has a dice pool maximum equal to your [[Planning]] rank.
Before you make a skill test, you may choose to substitue your [[Planning]] pool instead of the called skill.

When you choose to substitute your [[Planning]] pool, you use all the dice in the pool.
Each time you fail a skill roll, add one die to your [[Planning]] pool.
When you have a day of non-strenuous downtime activity, you may add one die to your [[Planning]] pool.




## Alchemist
- Role ability: **Synthesis**

Requires 4 hours and 200kr worth of reagents to synthesize a batch of [[Infusions]]. The number of usable doses is equal to the number of [[Synthesis]] successes. It requires an Action to administer an infusion.

## Archanist
- Role ability: **Ætherlink**

Make a connection with a target in line-of-sight within 50 meters. An [[Arcanist]] can sense the distance (but not direction) of a connected target. Maintaining a connection does not require line of sight. Connections break when the distance between a target and the [[Arcanist]] exceeds 50 meters. An [[Arcanist]] can use an [[Action]] to manifest up to 3 [[Invocations]] (Only 1 Invocation per connection per turn).

### Invocations

- [Variable] Depends on complexity of effect.





## Underboss
- Role ability: **Goons**

A [[Goon]] is a non-player ally.
An [[Underboss]] starts with and may have up to 2 Goons.

It takes 7 days of effort to recruit a new [[Goon]].
When you recruit a [[Goon]], choose their name, a brief description, one of the [[Goon Archetypes]], and [[Goon Capabilities]] equal to your [[Underboss]] rank.

### Goon Loyalty
A goon starts with **6 Loyalty** and **0 Distrust**.

The following things will cause a [[Goon]] to gain a point of loyalty:
- Free weekends or holidays. The weekend is the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day of each month.
- Large bonuses of Kronor or other valuable items

The following things will cause a [[Goon]] to lose a point of loyalty:
- Accompanying you on a mission
- Being shot at or placed in mortal danger
- Conducting extensive research or stakeouts to uncover hidden information
- Rushing downtime jobs

When loyalty reaches 0, the [[Goon]] marks a point of Distrust and has loyalty reset to 6.
The [[Director]] will secretly roll a d6.
If the number rolled is equal to or lesser than the Goon's Distrust rating, the goon is now disloyal.

A disloyal goon will prioritize their own interests over their Underboss.
They might quit immediately, start embezzling money - or in more extreme situations - betray their former boss to their enemies.

### Goon Archetypes
A [[Goon]] has the benefit of one of the following archetypes:
- **Bodyguard**: 50% chance to not lose loyalty when put in a life-threatening situation or fired upon.
- **Informant**: 50% chance to not lose loyalty when tasked with information gathering jobs.
- **Specialist**: 50% chance to not lose loyalty when asked to rush downtime work.

### Goon Capabilities
A [[Goon]] has a number of capabilities equal to the [[Underboss]]'s rank:
- **Motor Pool**: (1wk repairs)
- **Lookout**:
- **Small Arms Training**:
- **Heavy Weapons Guy**:
- **Arcane Engineer**:
- **Clothier / Tailor**:
- **Amateur Chemist**:
- **Private Eye**: (Research + Stakeout)
- **Costume Stealth Guy**:
